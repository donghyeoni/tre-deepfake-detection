# TRE Diffusion Image Detection

Detecting AI-generated images from the **Temporal Reconstruction Error (TRE)**
of a diffusion model, classified by temporal / spatial attention.

This repository holds the code, the **full-scale re-run of the experiment**, and
the analysis of what the method actually measures. The headline finding is
negative and is the point of the repository: as formulated, the TRE feature
carries no usable signal, and we show why.

## Results

GenImage. Train: SDv1.4, 30k fake + 30k real (seed 42), 20 epochs. Evaluation:
all 8 generators, full test splits (12k each, 16k for sdv5). Identical
classifier and hyperparameters in both conditions — the only difference is how
the reconstruction is driven.

| Condition | Train acc | Held-out val acc | **Mean acc (8 generators)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A. Replayed noise** (as originally formulated) | 78.7% | 63.5% | **57.7%** |
| **B. Fresh common noise** (attempted fix) | 96.3% | 50.7% | **50.1%** |
| **C. Deterministic, η = 0** | — | 80.9% | **60.5%** |
| **C + second inverter** (SD1.4 ++ SD1.5, 8 ch) | — | 80.2% | **62.5%** |

Scheme C is the one that measures something real, but the mean hides the actual
result — it splits sharply by generator family, and adding a second inverter
from the *same* family does not move it:

| Grouped | Scheme C | C + second inverter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stable-Diffusion-derived (sdv4, sdv5, wukong) — same family as the inverter | **78.8%** | **78.9%** |
| Everything else (adm, biggan, glide, midjourney, vqdm) | **49.5%** | **52.7%** |

Per generator, raw numbers in [`results/repro.json`](results/repro.json),
[`results/fresh.json`](results/fresh.json) and [`results/eta0.json`](results/eta0.json).
The three SD-derived generators are marked ◆:

| | sdv4 ◆ (in-domain) | sdv5 ◆ | wukong ◆ | adm | biggan | glide | midjourney | vqdm | **mean** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A: replayed — acc | 61.5 | 62.2 | 59.8 | 54.4 | 54.7 | 58.1 | 55.0 | 56.2 | **57.7** |
| A: replayed — AP | .642 | .648 | .623 | .541 | .560 | .593 | .552 | .562 | — |
| B: fresh — acc | 50.1 | 50.7 | 50.1 | 49.9 | 49.3 | 50.5 | 50.1 | 50.4 | **50.1** |
| B: fresh — AP | .503 | .504 | .505 | .499 | .490 | .504 | .499 | .503 | — |
| C: η = 0 — acc | **78.5** | **79.2** | **78.5** | 50.6 | 39.8 | 49.1 | 54.8 | 53.3 | **60.5** |
| C: η = 0 — AP | **.863** | **.869** | **.861** | .510 | .360 | .481 | .560 | .542 | — |
| C + 2nd inverter — acc | **79.3** | **79.2** | **78.2** | 52.9 | 45.5 | 53.8 | 55.3 | 55.9 | **62.5** |
| C + 2nd inverter — AP | **.870** | **.877** | **.862** | .538 | .429 | .549 | .567 | .576 | — |

**Condition A barely beats chance even in-domain (61.5%)** and drops to 54-60%
on unseen generators. **Condition B is exactly chance everywhere** while fitting
the training set to 96%. **Condition C works — but only inside the Stable
Diffusion family**: 78-79% with AP 0.86 on sdv4/sdv5/wukong, chance elsewhere
(biggan at 39.8% is below chance, i.e. anti-correlated).

## Why: the feature collapses either way

All three schemes share one skeleton — encode, walk the latent to noise,
reconstruct from every prefix, take the differences of consecutive
reconstructions. They differ only in the stochasticity coefficient `η` and in
what fills the noise slot of a reverse step:

![the three TRE schemes](assets/tre-schemes.svg)

The same input image, put through all three: the feature is a float-level
residue in A, pure noise in B, and structured reconstruction error in C.

*Input image: ImageNet ILSVRC2012 validation sample (real photograph),
distributed as the `nature` split of the GenImage benchmark. Heatmaps show the
channel mean of the TRE tensor; note the per-row scale annotation — A's range is
~10⁻⁴ while B's is ~1.*

The pipeline uses *edit-friendly* DDPM inversion, which records, for every step,
the noise `z_t` that makes the reverse process land exactly on the pre-sampled
`x_{t-1}`. TRE is then defined as the difference between reconstructions started
from different prefixes of that noise sequence.

- **Replaying `z_t`** (condition A) makes every prefix reconstruct the *same*
  latent by construction, so the difference is mathematically zero. What remains
  is GPU floating-point non-determinism: measured `std ~ 2.7e-4` against a latent
  scale of ~1. The weak in-domain signal is that residue's image-dependent
  pattern, which is why it does not transfer across generators.
- **Injecting fresh noise** (condition B) makes prefixes genuinely differ, but
  the variance term `sigma_t * eps_t` dominates: prefixes of different length
  accumulate a different number of such terms, so the difference is driven by the
  image's random draw rather than by how well the model explains the image. The
  classifier memorises the draw (96% train) and transfers nothing.

Either way the stochastic reverse process destroys the quantity the method
intends to measure. Full derivation, measurements and follow-up directions:
[`docs/finding-tre-collapse.md`](docs/finding-tre-collapse.md) and
[`docs/ideas-generalization.md`](docs/ideas-generalization.md).

**Scheme C (`η = 0`) — the feature works, the generalisation does not.**
Dropping the stochastic term leaves the prefix differences to reflect only DDIM
inversion error, i.e. how accurately the model round-trips the image. The feature
magnitude rises ~500x over scheme A (std 0.20 vs 2·10⁻⁴), and real photographs
carry a ~17% larger error than generated ones — the direction DIRE/LaRE-style
detectors rely on. At full scale that turns into a genuine detector for images
made by the *same model family as the inverter* (SD v1.4): 78-79% accuracy at
AP 0.86 on sdv4, sdv5 and wukong, and the held-out validation accuracy reaches
80.9%.

Outside that family it collapses to chance, and on biggan it inverts (39.8%,
AP 0.36) — a GAN's latents are not something an SD inverter round-trips the way
it does its own samples, so the learned direction points the wrong way. So the
three schemes fail for three different reasons: A has no signal, B has signal
buried in noise, C has signal that is specific to one generator family.

Three follow-ups pinned down *why* C is family-bound, and each has its own file
in [`results/`](results):

- **Leave-one-generator-out** ([`logo.json`](results/logo.json)) — train on five
  generators, test on the sixth, six times. Held-out accuracy is chance in every
  split (mean 51.7%), and validation on the five *trained* generators only
  reaches 51.8-58.2%. wukong falls from 78.5% to 50.4% once its training set is
  the five non-SD generators. **Training diversity does not substitute for the
  inverter's own family** — the bias lives in the feature, not the data mix.
- **3-class head** ([`threeclass.json`](results/threeclass.json)) — predicting
  real / diffusion-fake / GAN-fake removes biggan's inversion (39.8% → 63.4%,
  AP 0.36 → 0.68). The anti-correlation was class structure, not noise.
- **Two-inverter ensemble** ([`ensemble.json`](results/ensemble.json)) — SD 1.4
  and SD 1.5 features concatenated on the channel axis. SD family unchanged
  (78.8 → 78.9%), others barely move (49.5 → 52.7%). SD 1.5 alone scores the
  same as SD 1.4 alone, so the two inverters see the same thing. The intended
  second arm was SD 2.1, but every `stabilityai/*` repository is gated, so this
  run cannot test a genuinely *different* family — which is exactly the
  hypothesis that matters.

Chasing general detection from one model family's reconstruction error looks
like the wrong axis — see
[`docs/ideas-generalization.md`](docs/ideas-generalization.md) for what remains,
and [`docs/REPRODUCTION.md`](docs/REPRODUCTION.md) to re-run any of it.

## Method / code layout

1. **Diffusion inversion** ([`src/data/inversion.py`](src/data/inversion.py)) —
   edit-friendly DDPM/DDIM inversion: `inversion_forward_process` records the
   noise sequence, `inversion_reverse_process` reconstructs from it.
2. **TRE features** ([`src/data/tre_features.py`](src/data/tre_features.py)) —
   `over_denosing()` reconstructs prefix by prefix and returns the `T` step-wise
   latent differences, a `(T=20, 4, 32, 32)` tensor per image.
3. **Classifiers** ([`src/models/`](src/models)) — `resnet_baseline.py` holds the
   temporal-MHSA x spatial-focusing -> ResNet18 detector used in both conditions;
   `dnsamnet.py` / `attention.py` / `temporal_attention.py` /
   `spatial_attention.py` hold the hand-written attention variant (DNSAMNet),
   which needs a different feature type (U-Net attention maps) and is untested.

The experiment scripts import `src/config.py`, `src/data/inversion.py` and
`src/models/resnet_baseline.py`; `experiments/extract_tre.py` is the batched
port of `src/data/tre_features.py`. The remaining `src/` modules (`train.py`,
`eval.py`, `data/build_dataset.py`, `data/dataset.py` and the DNSAMNet models)
are the original notebook pipeline and are not called by the experiments.

## Reproducing

Data is not included. Download GenImage from its
[official release](https://github.com/GenImage-Dataset/GenImage) (an HF mirror of
the same archives exists at `jzousz/GenImage`), then see
[`experiments/README.md`](experiments/README.md) for the exact pipeline:

```bash
python experiments/build_lists.py                       # train/test file lists
python experiments/extract_tre.py --list ... --out ...  # add --fresh for condition B
python experiments/train_eval.py --features ...         # train + per-generator eval
```

Feature extraction is the bottleneck: the prefix construction costs 250 UNet
calls per image (~0.83 img/s per L40S at batch 48), i.e. roughly 20 GPU-hours
per condition for the 160k images. Precomputed `.pt` features and trained
weights are not distributed.

Environment: Python 3.11, torch 2.3.1+cu121, torchvision 0.18.1,
diffusers 0.31.0, transformers 4.44.2, numpy<2. Features are computed in fp32
and stored as fp16 — condition A's signal lives at the 1e-4 level, so lowering
the compute precision destroys it.

## Fixed while re-running

Both bugs were latent because the original notebooks never completed a run:

- `AttentionClassifier` passed a 5-D `(B,T,C,H,W)` tensor to `SpatialFocusing`,
  which unpacks four dimensions — now the channel axis is averaged first.
- `build_dataset.py` wrote features to the wrong class directory: GenImage class
  dirs sort as `[ai, nature]`, so indexing `LABEL_MAP` by the numeric label put
  fakes under `real/` and vice versa — now mapped by class name.

Also: accuracy thresholding at `> 0` on a sigmoid output (always true) was
corrected to `> 0.5`; `SpatialFocusing` referenced an undefined `num_head`;
hard-coded machine paths moved to `src/config.py`.
